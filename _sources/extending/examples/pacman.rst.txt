In this example we show how pacman can be drawn by defining your own custom
:code:`Shape` class. Building on the built in :code:`Circle` shape the definition is
quite simple as long as we remember that the :code:`in_circle`, and :code:`not_in_mouth`
variables are numpy arrays so they need to be combined using the :code:`np.logical_xxx`
functions from numpy.
